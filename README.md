# Webpack Front-End Boilerplate

Write your code in `src/js/main.js` and `src/scss/main.scss` and it will compile to `dist` directory.

First, run `npm install` and use `npm run build:dev` for development build or `npm run build:production` for production build.

You can also use `npm run watch` to watch changes in files and compile as you edit.
